<h1>The Best Movies According To Freddy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>An incredible time piece that tells of a brilliant general that was set to inherit the Roman Empire but then is betrayed and ends up as a gladiator in Rome.</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>The greatest movie of all time on IMBD. It's a story about a man wrongly accused and sentenced to prison and how he finds his path to redemption.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>This movie introduces a deadbeat insomniac who meets a mysterious stranger on a plane and ends up twisted into a terrorist group set on disrupting the world as we know it.</p>
